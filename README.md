# The Little Python Book
by Dr Liang Jin

This repo is designed for python beginners. There are tons of tutorials on Python out there by genius developers and academics who have far more programming knowledge than me, but this is a small and humble guide from me, for fellows who have no prior experience in Python language and want to make the faith jump. I truly hope this guide can be helpful in some way and make your Python programming journey easier to start. In paralle, this repo is also for myself as a treasure box where I can keep notes for what I have learned and collect invaluable resources from the Python community around the world.

Happy Hacking!

## Quick Start
Download the repo zip file by clicking the green button, or alternatively, if you are happy with command line, you can of course `git clone` it to your computer by entering:
```
git clone https://github.com/drliangjin/the-little-python-book.git
```

Launch your Jupyter Notebook Desktop app (Windows), or if you are comfortable with terminal, `cd` into the folder with *ipynb* files and type in `jupyter notebook`. Here we go!

## Install Anaconda Distribution (including Jupyter Notebook) on your machine
Please go to [Anaconda download page](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and select **Python 3.x** version for your operation system.
After downloading the binary, follow the installer and you should be ready to rock!
